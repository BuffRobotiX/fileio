File I/O in many programming languages
Derived from this SO post:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3538156/file-i-o-in-every-programming-language
---------
Each piece of code must accomplish the following:
1. Create a new text file called "fileio.txt"
2. Write the first line "hello" to the text file.
3. Append the second line "world" to the text file.
4. Read the second line "world" into an input string.
5. Print the input string to the console.

For each example, it is assumed that the text file doesn't exist beforehand. There is also no need to reopen the text file after writing the first line.
